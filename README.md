## How to play?
Board is 10x10 fields. Players are placed as far as possible from each other. At top left and bottom right corners.

Each move has a few different options:
1. You can move to highlighted fields
2. If opponent is in the path, you can attack him

## How does the fight work?
Both players can choose Attack / Defend mode when fight occurs.
Choosing attack will deal damage to other player. If one chose defend,
he will take half of damage.

## When does it end?
End comes where one of the players loses all HP.
